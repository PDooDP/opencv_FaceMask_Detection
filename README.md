# opencv_FaceMask_Detection
1. Recognize if a person is wearing or not wearing a mask using AlexeyAB-darknet YOLO and I re-labelled 600 images using labelImg.

2. Custom trained weights are removed from the backup folder and yolov4.conv.137 because they exceeded github's file size limit.

3. You can train your own weights using yolov4-custom.cfg if you'd like to give this project a try, then put the weight files into backup folder.

4. Image files are from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection'>Face Mask Detection - Kaggle</a>.
