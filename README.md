# opencv_FaceMask_Detection
1. Recognize if a person is wearing or not wearing a mask using AlexeyAB-darknet YOLO.

2. You can train your own weights using yolov4-custom.cfg if you'd like to give this project a try, then put the weight files into backup folder.

3. Dataset is from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection'>Face Mask Detection - Kaggle</a>, and I re-labelled 600 images myself using labelImg.

4. Please copy the yolov4.conv.137 file to train folder.
